            <h2 class="bubble-info-title">How To Set Up JSON File</h2>
            <p>The JSON file containing data for the bigs and littles in this recruitment term has a specific layout you must follow to ensure the program can read the data accurately. 
                There are two ways data can be represented. Curley brackets, {}, which represent objects and square brackets, [], which represent arrays. 
                Objects are keys that have a value attatched to them. Arrays are a list of values separated by commas. 
            </p>

        <h2 class="bubble-info-title">JSON File Structure</h2>
        <p>
            The file structure consists of two main sections: "bigs" array and "littles" array. 
            Both sections contain an array of objects representing the members and associate members involved in the recruitment process.
            In other words, the "bigs" array will contain a list of all the participating members and the "littles" array will contain all the associate members.
        </p>
        <h3>"bigs" Structure</h3>
        <p>
            "bigs" is an array of objects. Each object representing a big has a "name", "preferenceSurvey", and "slotsAvailable". 
            <ul>
                <li><b>"name": "Big's Name"</b> </li>
                <li><b>"preferenceSurvey": ["Little 3", "Little 2", "Little 1"]</b> The array of little names that the big prefers in that order.</li>
                <li><b>"slotsAvailable": #</b> The number of littles a big is willing to take. Either one or two. </li>
            
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>"littles" Structure</h3>
        <p>
            "littles" is an array of objects. Each object representing a little has a "name" and "preferenceSurvey". 
            <ul>
                <li><b>"name": "Little's Name"</b> </li>
                <li><b>"preferenceSurvey": ["Big 3", "Big 2", "Big 1"]</b> The key "preferenceSurvey" represents an array of big names that the little prefers in that order.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 class="both-bubble-info-title">Sample JSON File</h2>

                <li>Make sure all names are spelled correctly.</li>

        <p>
            Once all data in your JSON file is updated and accurate, save the file with a .json extension, for example, recruitment_data.json.
            In the next section of the website, click the Choose File button and select the JSON file you previously saved.  
            If all went accordingly, the results will display in the below section.
